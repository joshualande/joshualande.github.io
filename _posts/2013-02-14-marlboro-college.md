I went to [Marlboro College](http://www.marlboro.edu) and graduated
in 2008.  Marlboro is a liberal arts school in the beautiful hills
of [Marlboro, Vermont](http://marlboro.vt.us) with a very small
student body of 300 students. I loved my experience at Marlboro
and excelled in the environment, majoring in Physics and minoring
in Computer Science.  I participated in three summer physics
internships and wrote a senior thesis (described below).

# Undergraduate Research

During the summer after my senior year of high school (2005) and
again after my first year of college (2006), I participated in a
[SEAP](http://seap.asee.org/program_details) internship at
[ANSER](http://www.anser.org). I have written about the
internship [here](http://joshualande.com/academics/seap-internship).

After my sophomore year (2006), I participated in a [physics REU
at UC Davis](http://london.ucdavis.edu/~reu/REU06/reu06.html). I
have written about the
internship [here](http://joshualande.com/academics/2006-uc-davis-reu).

After my Junior year (2007), I participated in a [SULI Internship
at SLAC](http://www-group.slac.stanford.edu/aao/suli.asp). I have
written about the
internship [here](http://joshualande.com/academics/slac-suli-internship).

# Senior Thesis

Marlboro students are required to write a senior thesis during their
senior year. My senior thesis involved continuing research I began
during the SULI internship and an experimental investivation of
[microwave
diffraction](http://www.pasco.com/prodCatalog/WA/WA-9316_advanced-microwave-optics-system).
You can view my senior thesis below.  You can read my senior thesis
