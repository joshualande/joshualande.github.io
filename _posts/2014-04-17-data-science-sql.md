title: What Every Data Scientist Needs to Know about SQL
comments: true
---

One of the most important tools required to be a successful data
scientist is relational databases like
[SQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL).  The majority of data
stored by businesses is in these relational databases. And in
addition, they are exceptionally good at storing complicated business
data sets as well as allowing for efficient information retrieval.
So having a strong understanding of relational databases is essential
to being an effective data scientist.

In this series of posts, I will provide a broad overview of the key
topics required to successfully work with databases to do effective
data science. My hope is to take a breath-first search approach to
teaching by introducing the most important topics first.  Whenever
possible, I will attempt to avoid theory in favor of practicality
with the goal of getting you up to speed as quickly as possible.

In these posts, I will focus on the [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/)
database because it is free, open source, and easy to get started
with. But the concepts and most of the commands are easily transferable
to other databases.

The posts in this series are:

1. **"Design a Better Database With Database Normalization"**

   In this post, we will go over the design decisions behind
   databases, how they are different from other programming languages
   and data formats, and how to lay out our data so that it will
   fit into a SQL database.  By way of a simple example, we will
   go over the basics of database normalization, the best-practice
   for correctly storing complex data in a database.  Despite being
   a bit abstract and theoretical, these topics are absolutely
   essential to understanding how databases work and why they are
   so good at what they do. So this is a must read.

2. **"How to Query in SQL With the SELECT Statement"**

   In this post, we will go over the basics of querying data from
   a database. Using the example from above, I will work through
   successively harder queries show how the simple operations can
   be used to ask complicated questions.

3. **"Indexing in SQL for the Rest of Us"**

4. **"How to Handle Missing Data in SQL Using NULL Values"**
