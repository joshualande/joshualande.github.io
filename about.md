I am a Data Scientist at [Twitter](http://twitter.com) working on
their analytics team. I have always been fascinated by technology
and especially tools for analysing and interpreting information.
I want to use this website to help teach people new skills.
Recently, I have written about 
[Jekyll]({% post_url 2014-02-03-jekyll-github-pages-poole %}) and
[Apache Pig]({% post_url 2014-02-11-cube-rollup-pig-data-science %}).

Before working at Twitter, I was a Data Science Fellow at the
[Insight Data Science Fellowship](http://insightdatascience.com).
Before that, I got a PhD in physics from [Stanford
Univeristy](http://stanford.edu) studying [pulsar wind
Nebulae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar_wind_nebula).  I have
written about my PhD research experince 
[here]({% post_url 2013-02-14-searching-pulsar-wind-nebulae-kiapc %}), and software I helped
develope during my PhD [here]({% post_url 2013-02-01-pointlike-fitting-package %}).

Before that, I was an undergraduate at [Marlboro
College](http://www.marlboro.edu/) in Vermont.  I wrote about my
undergraduate research
[here]({% post_url 2013-02-14-physics-marlboro-college-vermont %}), as
well as my research during two undergraduate physics internships
[here]({% post_url 2013-02-14-health-impact-solar-particle-events-sstorm %}), and
[here]({% post_url 2013-02-12-simulating-deep-lens-survey-davis %}).
